Create a new project and ask before saving workspace between sessions. Will open up a new project document and restart R. Only need to do once at the start of a new project. 
```{r project setup, eval=FALSE}
#create new project file
usethis::create_project(path = "Oxford/R/R courses/Tools for reproducable research/")
usethis::use_blank_slate(scope = "project")
```
